osc2 is an object-oriented rewrite of the Open Build Service command line
tool osc.

Its aim is to improve the code structure and to provide a consistent
commandline interface.

osc2 was developed in a number of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects, and
condensed status reports were given regularly on the Open Build Service
mailing list (http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-buildservice/), in 2011 as
"osc code cleanup", and in 2012 as "osc2 client". Additionally more information
about osc2 can be found here http://lizards.opensuse.org/author/marcus_h/.
